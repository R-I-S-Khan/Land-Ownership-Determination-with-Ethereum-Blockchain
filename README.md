# Land-Ownership-Determination-with-Ethereum-Blockchain
This project demonstrates a very simple solution to ensure property ownership and security using Ethereum Blockchain

# Project Description
Let us consider the case of inheritance between two family members. Suppose Annie's father dies and before death gives the property to his daughter. After the death of Annie's father, uncle Sam comes and demands the right to the piece of property. How can Annie prove that the property is indeed hers without running to court rooms, filing cases, spending money and time? Keep in consideration that uncle Sam is clever and deceitful who can bribe authorities into making the ownership of the land in her name.  So here, we need such a system which can do the followings-

1. Able to track and store data 
2. Creates trust and transparency
3. No Contact of Intermediaries

We have provided details and explanation into how this problem can be solved using Blockchain. Please refer Report.pdf.
